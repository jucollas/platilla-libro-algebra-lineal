# Templates for interactive coding and non-coding elements

Lastly some example pages are shown which combine theory and interactive questions and coding to different degrees. The following templates are given:

1. [Programming Assignments](example_gumbel.ipynb)

    This page shows how you can recreate the classical Jupyter Notebook assignments that are given in many courses to a Jupyter Book format with live coding. 

```{Note}
Keep in mind that Jupyter Book sections might not be the best environment for programming assignments you have in mind for your course due to the limitation posed by jupyter book. In fact, in jupyter book, python runs in the browser of the students' laptop. Nothing needs to be installed which can be an advantage but also a disadvantage depending on the learning goals of your course. TeachBooks suggests using it's live coding feature to support the theory in textbooks and not as a replacement for Jupyter Notebook.
```

2. [Combining theory with interactive questions and extensive coding assignments](example_quiz_interactive.ipynb)

    This page shows an example on how to combine theory, quizzes and live code on one page.

3. [Combining coding theory with interactive questions and live coding](coding_theory_widgets.ipynb)

    This page shows an example on how to combine the introduction of a certain coding implementation with interactive questions. Compared to the previous template, the learning objective is to learn a new skill in programming using the live coding feature whereas before programming was used to illustrate a theoretic concept unrelated to coding (for example statistics).

4. [Parametric Question](parametric_questions.ipynb)
    
    On this page, an example is given for parametric questions in which an equation is checked on equivalence with the correct answer.

These templates make use of the following applications in various combinations:

- Admonitions
- JupyterQuiz
- H5p
- Grasple-exercises
- Interactive widgets
- Live coding exercise checking with widgets

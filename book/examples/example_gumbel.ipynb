In fact, in jupyter book, python runs in the browser of the students' laptop. Nothing needs to be installed which can be an advantage but also a disadvantage depending on the learning goals of your course. TeachBooks suggests using it's live coding feature to support the theory in textbooks and not as a replacement for Jupyter Notebook.\n",

A previous benchmark study estimates that there is a 10% and 1% chance, respectively, of exceeding 4 and 10 ppm, respectively. You have been asked by the regulatory agency to estimate the contaminant concentration with 0.1% probability of being exceeded. Prior studies suggest that a Gumbel distribution can be used to model contaminant concentration, given by the CDF:\n",
